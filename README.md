# The-bAbI-project
The project uses the bAbI dataset from Facebook Research. bAbI dataset is composed of several sets to support 20 tasks for testing text understanding and reasoning as part of the bAbI project. The aim is that each task tests a unique aspect of text and reasoning, and hence test different capabilities of learning models.
